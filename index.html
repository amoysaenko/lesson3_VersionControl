            </h2>
            <p class="lead">When you have multiple team members working on the same files and using basic naming conventions, like numbering each new file, it gets harder and harder to correctly manage files and all the latest versions of those files. A solution to this issue is having version control. Version Control is having one main repository for all of a project’s files. Different team members can easily check files out, make changes, then check them back in (or commit them). This solves the file-sharing problem and is the main advantage of version control. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Now a Version Control System (VCS) manages all versions and files for a project in an organized manner. A VCS automatically tracks and notes when files have been changes and by who (revision history) and what about the files is new or was modified. A VCS also automatically merges changes to the same file. There are numerous benefits of VCS including that files cannot be overwritten, there is a common repository with the latest files, and people can work on the same files simultaneous without issues. Because a VCS has a common repository, you can easily revert to a previous version of a file and your files will always be backed up.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A repository is storage of all versions of a file. One type of repository is a remote repository. A remote repository is a repository that resides on a remote server that is shared among multiple team members. A remote repository can be viewed and cloned onto someone’s local repository.	</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A local repository is a repository that resides on a local machine of an individual user. This repository is better suitable for projects that don’t require sharing among multiple team members. There are two ways to create a local repository. The first way is to create a brand new repository. The second way is to clone an existing remote repository onto your local machine. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">GIT</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a free and open source Version Control System. It is a very popular VCS because it is designed to be able to control small to very large projects with efficiency. It is used by large companies such as Google and Netflix. There are many reasons people would choose to use gif including that it is a distributed VCS, so every user has a complete copy of the repository data stored locally on their machine. Since everything is locally stored, you can work on your files while offline. There is also no single point of failure and processes run much faster. Git will also prevent unintentionally overwriting files on the shared repository. </p>
