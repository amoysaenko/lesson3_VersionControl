## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. There are two types of respositories: remote and local. A remote repository is a repository that resides on a remote server that is shared among multiple team members. A local repository is a repository that resides on a local machine of an individual user. 
2. A Version Control System (VCS) can help manage files for a project. It is one main repository for all of a project's files. It automatically tracks the changes that are made to a file and easiy allows you to revert back to an older version of the file.
3. Git is an example of a VCS. It is designed to control small to large projects efficiently. It allows every user to have a complete copy of the repository data locally on their machine and it prevents unintentional overwrite of a file.
